#  Specular Texture Generator

This app generates specular textures from pngs. 

In ViewController.swift, load up six faces of a cube texture, and name them posx.png, negx.png etc.
Change the dimensions to be the size you require, and change the number of mipmap levels.
 
Create a directory called **specular** in **Documents** to hold the generated textures. 

**Warning:** If you don't create the specular directory, all the generated textures will land in **Documents**.
