#  Irradiance Texture Generator

This app generates irradiance textures from pngs. 

In ViewController.swift, load up six faces of a cube texture, and name them posx.png, negx.png etc.

Change the dimensions to be the size you require, and change the roughness level.

The app saves the png to the Documents folder

The more roughness, the more diffuse is the generated texture. However, it takes longer to produce
